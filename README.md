#  Spoonacular-API-Assistant

I created this project for Advanced.NET programming. This project interacts with Spoonacular's api (https://spoonacular.com/food-api) The most interesting thing this project does is ask for a list of ingredients. It will take that list and provide recipes that have those ingredients. I found this very helpful when I have random stuff in the fridge and have no idea how to make it into a meal.

## Demo

to demo the project open the spoonacular.exe file
